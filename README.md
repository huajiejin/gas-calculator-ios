This is the solution of a group assignment.

We want to show you how we collaborate on github, using pull requests.

## Requirements

> The goal of the application will remain the same:
> 
> • For Group 1: you will enter legs of the trip with distance in miles and calculate total distance in kilometers
> 
> • For Group 2: you will enter legs of the trip with gas usage in gallons and calculate total use in liters
> 
> The application must have two screens:
>  
> • First (initial) screen will have a table, which will display all legs of your trip. The table must use source, destination, and number (mileage or gas) displayed in each cell. You can add a picture to the cell if you would like (bonus)
> 
> • The second screen must have the form, which will allow you to edit the data selected in the first screen. You must ONLY use stack combination to achieve this.
> 
> The screens must be connected via segue. To add data to the table you can use two mechanisms:
> 
> • You can use alert controller as shown
> 
> • You can use the form, which you created for editing (bonus)
> 
> The navigation between screens must be facilitated using Navigation Controller as shown in Lecture 8. You must be able to pass data using segue and view appearance control functions learned previously. No buttons are allowed for navigation (only for adding and editing the data in the table)
> 
> The application must be able to save the data when going to background and subsequently retrieve the data on start. Save/Retrieve must be done through encode/decode. No other way will be accepted
